This file contains information about interacting with the client and acquiring information about how they want their website to be designed;

* Bring some site examples to show the client (because a lot of clients have no idee what they want).
* Everything is important = nothing is important. Encourage the client not to lay a lot of info on the website, but only important information. 
* Acquire information about the client (for ex, if they allready have a website, and want a new, better one, check out that website).
* Inform the client about how important is for them to invest in the website (artists, photographers etc.).
* Limit the number of client reviews during the process of the site`s development. (for ex limit the reviews at 3 free, and the next ones not).
* Differenciate the graphic design from coding (first graphic design, then coding).
